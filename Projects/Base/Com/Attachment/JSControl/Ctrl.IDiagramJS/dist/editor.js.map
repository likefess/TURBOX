events and realizes\n * the general \"drag-and-drop\" look and feel.\n *\n * Calling {@link Dragging#activate} activates dragging on a canvas.\n *\n * It provides the following:\n *\n *   * emits life cycle events, namespaced with a prefix assigned\n *     during dragging activation\n *   * sets and restores the cursor\n *   * sets and restores the selection if elements still exist\n *   * ensures there can be only one drag operation active at a time\n *\n * Dragging may be canceled manually by calling {@link Dragging#cancel}\n * or by pressing ESC.\n *\n *\n * ## Life-cycle events\n *\n * Dragging can be in three different states, off, initialized\n * and active.\n *\n * (1) off: no dragging operation is in progress\n * (2) initialized: a new drag operation got initialized but not yet\n *                  started (i.e. because of no initial move)\n * (3) started: dragging is in progress\n *\n * Eventually dragging will be off again after a drag operation has\n * been ended or canceled via user click or ESC key press.\n *\n * To indicate transitions between these states dragging emits generic\n * life-cycle events with the `drag.` prefix _and_ events namespaced\n * to a prefix choosen by a user during drag initialization.\n *\n * The following events are emitted (appropriately prefixed) via\n * the {@link EventBus}.\n *\n * * `init`\n * * `start`\n * * `move`\n * * `end`\n * * `ended` (dragging already in off state)\n * * `cancel` (only if previously started)\n * * `canceled` (dragging already in off state, only if previously started)\n * * `cleanup`\n *\n *\n * @example\n *\n * function MyDragComponent(eventBus, dragging) {\n *\n *   eventBus.on('mydrag.start', function(event) {\n *     console.log('yes, we start dragging');\n *   });\n *\n *
